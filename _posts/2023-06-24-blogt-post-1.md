😀 Here is my mindset about prompt design

</aside>

# 📝 Never

## Never ask AI derectly

> AI is a combition of enormous information, so you’d better design excellent prompt to help you generate the answer you want

What’s the main difference between GPT 3.5 and GPT4? 

It’s about the ability to understand human orders. In other words, it’s the ablity of understanding user input. As long as your input is detailed enough, GPT 3.5 can work same like GPT 4. 

## Never use AI to improve your prompt

> Use AI to feed AI or command AI will make your AI Bot work like a stupid robot.
> 

I designed a lot of bots these days,  and I start to realize the importance of imagination and logistics. Question like “What if ”, “How about  another ” , will give you new design of your prompt. 

You can use gpt help you add details, and change your format.

But if you dare to use chat gpt help you modify your prompt, it’ll never understand you. Trust me

# Business behind Future Prompts

Many people are not willing to pay for prompt at the beginning, however, once the AI is getting smarter, that will happen. 

Let me explain deeper, If you have a bunch of detailed, well designed prompts, you can use GPT 3.5 work like GP4 or even GPT 5 in the future. Maybe you need to pay for GPT5 $50 a month, GPT4-$20 a month in the future. But you can buy maybe $5 promptS to use GPT 3.5 work like GPT5.
