The truth that I learned after 2019
======
* The real world is not as simple as the textbook.
* 
* 
2019, the year of changing my life. That was the first time that I know Google, Youtube and other stuff outside the Great Firewall of China.

How ridiculous it is that there are still hundreds of millions of people in China who are still living without knowing the most powerful tools in the world.

I am not a genius, but I am not stupid. I am just a normal person who is willing to learn and work hard. I start to realize how many rights I have lost in the past 20+ years. Thanks to the real Internet, I start to understand why rich people in China are passionate to send their children to study abroad. The professors, the managers, the leaders, the elites, the rich people, they all know the truth. They just don't want you to know it.

2021, when I finally graduated from USTC with a master's degree, I decided to learn abroad and explore more about the world. I started to learn English, programming, finance, and other stuff.

2022, I made a plan,  --relearn everything.
